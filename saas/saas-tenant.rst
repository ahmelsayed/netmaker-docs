Tenant Creation and Management
=====================================

Introduction
===============
Software as a Service (SaaS) has revolutionized the way businesses and individuals access and use software applications. SaaS offerings provide a cloud-based model where software is hosted and maintained by a service provider, and users can access these applications through the internet. Each individual or organization that subscribes to a SaaS service is referred to as a "tenant."

Netmaker offers three types of tenants. Pricing for each tenant are listed on `our pricing page of our website <https://www.netmaker.io/pricing>`_

Free Tier 
-----------

Our free tier is what is built for you automatically when you sign up for our SAAS platform. There are limits to our free tier. They are listed on the link above.

You can only have one free Tier tenant at a time per account. If you would like to get another free tier tenant, you will have to delete the existing one.

Paid Tier
-----------

Our paid tier has the same limits as the free tier. Instead, you will be charged for usage outside of those tier limits. pricing listed on link above.

The paid tier has all the features of the pro version like meterics and relays. Once you create a paid tier tenant, you will have to enter payment information before you can use the paid tenant. Info on how to do that will be in our :doc:`billing section <./saas-billing>`.
