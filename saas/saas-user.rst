Users

Two Different User Pages
=========================

There are two routes to get to the users section. one is through the Users tab and the other is through the Manage Account tab.

The Manage Account route will allow you to invite users to your netmaker instance, remove users from your nemtaker instance, and transfer ownership of a netmaker instance to another user. 

The User tab route will let you manage user permissions of the users that are invited to your netmaker instance.

Adding a User
==================

send an invite
---------------

In the Manage Account section, click on the Add User button. This will bring up a modal to enter the email address of the user you would like to invite to your netmaker party.

That user will recieve an invite via email from ``admin@mail.netmaker.io``. If the invited user has not made an account yet with `<https://app.netmaker.io>`_, now is the time to do so.

You should see your invited user in your users section with an invite label next to it.

Accept the invite
------------------

After the invited recieves the email. there will be a link to `<https://app.netmaker.io>`_ to access their account or create one if they have not already.

In their account management, they should see a notification in the invite section to accept.

After accepting the invite, you should see the Netmaker instance on your list of tenants. like the one in the bottom of this list.

you are initally invited as a non-admin user by default. The owner of the tenant will have to change your permissions if needed in the users tab. More about that will be in the next section.
